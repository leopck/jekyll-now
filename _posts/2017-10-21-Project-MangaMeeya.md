**What is MangaMeeya?**

It is a fast and small image viewer that is commonly used in the Manga reading community.
This software isn't open source but it is very fast and would only take less than a few seconds to extract and open to view each images within a large and heavy zip file (400++ MB).

**What is so impressive about that?**

Well to begin with, most programs nowadays are very slow in opening large images and this is excluding extracting the image from a compressed file (e.g zip or rar).

**Okay, sounds cool. Why don't we just use MangaMeeya as it is?**

MangaMeeya is quite old and the original developer left without leaving the code open sourced. So the community isn't able to support this software for long. There are alternative, but after using them, MangaMeeya is still superior in terms of speed and image processing.
